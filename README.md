2. Configure the attributes of your own spacecraft, buy weapons or armors to increase the attack and defense attributes of the mecha or spacecraft, because most of the high-quality mineral resources are in the outer planets, and if you go to the outer planets to collect, you may be attacked.
3. Explore the universe and build relationships with other players.
4. Teaming up with other players to collect spar or looting spar from other teams is an effective way to get rich quickly.
