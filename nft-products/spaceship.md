# ðŸ›¸ Spaceship

You can buy it in the NFT market or get it through the blind box of the spaceship drawing.&#x20;

The spacecraft contains attributes such as mining power, combat power, defense power, durability, and storage space. Its attributes directly determine its mining efficiency and the outcome of each battle.

&#x20;Every time you perform a mission, the spacecraft will consume durability. When the durability is lower than 20%, the spacecraft will be forced to return to the base and enter the repair state. You can choose to repair automatically or use spar to accelerate repair Different spaceships have different weapon spaces and armor spaces. You can purchase weapons to increase the combat effectiveness of your spacecraft or purchase armor to increase your spacecraft's defense.

## Ship class

The spacecraft is divided into five levels according to different body types and uses.

Contains seven attributes of mining durability, mining power, attack power, protection power, storage space, weapon space, and protective cover space, which are divided into five levels, namely:

TYPE : Represents the type of spacecraft. Different spacecraft have different attributes. The higher the quality, the higher the attributes.

DMG : Represents the maximum damage that can be caused by each attack.

DEF : Represents the maximum damage that can be reduced each time you resist an attack.

MINE ï¼šThe number of resources that can be collected per hour.

STORAGE : Storage space, the larger the space, the more resources and equipment can be loaded. If the quantity is exceeded, you need to return to the base warehouse for unloading.

HP ï¼šDurability, the higher the durability, the more time it can be used and the more attacks it can withstand. The durability is too low or the nearest base needs to be repaired when it reaches zero.
