# ⛰ Mining machinery

The mining mech is a separate equipment for collecting spar. You first need to own a spaceship and then buy it before you can purchase it. Its mining efficiency has nothing to do with the spaceship’s mining power, and it will not occupy your spaceship’s storage space. The spaceship can only carry a certain number of mining mechas. The higher the mining power of the spaceship, the more mechas it can carry. The higher the level of mechas carried, the less the number of mechas that can be carried.

There are five levels of mining mechas. The higher the level, the higher the efficiency of collecting spar.
