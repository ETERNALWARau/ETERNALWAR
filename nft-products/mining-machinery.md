# ⛰ Mining machinery

Mining machinery is a separate equipment for collecting spar. You first need to own a spaceship and then buy it to purchase it. Its mining efficiency has nothing to do with the spacecraft’s mining power, and it will not occupy your spacecraft’s storage space. Only a certain number of mining machinery can be carried. The higher the mining power of the spacecraft, the more machinery it can carry. The higher the level of machinery it can carry, the smaller the number of machinery it can carry.

There are five levels of mining machinery. The higher the level, the higher the efficiency of collecting spar.
