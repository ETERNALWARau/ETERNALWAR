# White paper

## Overview

The meta-universe includes the information revolution (5G/6G), the Internet revolution (web3.0), the artificial intelligence revolution, and the results of the virtual reality technology revolution including VR, AR, and MR, especially game engines, showing humanity The possibility of constructing a holographic digital world parallel to the traditional physical world; triggered the interaction of information science, quantum science, mathematics and life sciences, and changed the scientific paradigm; promoted breakthroughs in traditional philosophy, sociology and even human science systems; included All digital technologies, including blockchain technology achievements; enrich the digital economy transformation model, integrate DeFi, IPFS, NFT and other digital financial achievements.

From a logical point of view, Metaverse will be a new type of Internet application and social form that integrates multiple new technologies. It provides immersive experience based on expanded reality technology, and generates a mirror image of the real world based on digital twin technology. Build an economic system based on blockchain technology, closely integrate the virtual world and the real world in the economic system, social system, and identity system, and allow each user to perform content production and world editing.

The Eternal War is building a unique virtual world based on the interstellar universe. In this world, the concept of Metaverse is closely integrated with the cryptocurrency economy. The Eternal War is committed to mining the truth of this world to create the second hometown of mankind. At the same time, users can use the platform's main utility token-ETR, which will be used as a medium of exchange in Metaverse. It can be used to buy, sell, trade and create in-game assets and profit from them.

Users of The Eternal War can also participate in the governance of the platform through a decentralized autonomous organization (autonomous organization for water supply), where they can exercise voting rights on the key decisions of The Eternal War ecosystem and can create digital assets ( Also known as non-fungible tokens, NFTs), upload them to the market for free trading.

At the same time, ETR will also be used for the entrance of various fields of Metaverse, for accessing games, parties, entertainment, education, travel in the metaverse, investing in virtual real estate, mining materials in games, and paying other players for services, social experiences and programs. And as currency in the physical world.

### Blockchain and NFTs

The Eternal War virtual world uses blockchain technology and NFTs to enhance the capabilities of players and creators. NFTs are an emerging part of the global gaming market: virtual tokens that represent digital scarcity, security and authenticity. Each non-functionality is unique, indivisible, and cannot be exchanged with another non-functionality.

By using NFTs, users of the sandbox The Eternal War will benefit from the following:

A. True digital ownership: Even if the game is closed or abandoned, players are still the true and permanent owners of their digital items. Through the blockchain, every game item can be tagged, allowing players to decide how they want to trade, sell or give away their items.

B. Security and immutability: Digital game projects can be easily marked and traded in the primary and secondary markets governed and promoted by blockchain technology. Projects based on scarcity and demand usually trigger fraud and theft, but blockchain minimizes these risks because it is a distributed ledger.

C. Transaction: A blockchain-based game platform can provide users with ultimate control over their digital assets. They can buy and sell items freely without worrying about being blackmailed, or worrying that the platform will shut down and cancel all the value of their in-game items.

D. Cross-application interoperability: Blockchain provides the ability for games to utilize shared assets. Assets, avatars, territories and any other game elements can be used in other games. These game projects are no longer limited to a narrow digital ecosystem.

## Story background

The Eternal War story takes place in the post-modern civilization period where human technology is highly developed in the future. The earth has long been integrated into the galaxy and has become a member of the galaxy civilization together with the alien civilization. It is attacked by the advanced civilization from the outer space of the galaxy, code-named Alpha galaxy. , The earth and other members of the galactic civilization formed the Galactic Warship Alliance to fight together to defend their homeland.

Barite spar is an indispensable element for the construction of warships and weapons in the post-modern era. Its stock is very scarce, and even became the universal currency in the galaxy. Therefore, going to the distant outer space to find more Barite spars has become every One of the most important tasks for members of the Allied Powers...

In the process of collecting spar, they will be attacked by other game players. Each player can also occupy other people’s planets as his own. On his own planet, in addition to supplying and repairing the spacecraft, he can also decide whether Collect fees from other players who come to mine to create your own empire legend...

You can also unite with other players to form a battleship alliance to prevent being attacked... Our game continues, and our story will continue...

## Identity Avatar

The character is the avatar of the player in the game, and the player can modify it. Character avatars have specific specifications and formats, and come with a set of default animations, such as walking, running, jumping, and fighting. This avatar can be modified piece by piece (helmet, arms, torso, legs, etc.) by equipping it with different compatible tokens.

## Equipment

### Spaceship

You can buy it in the NFT market or get it through the blind box of the spaceship drawing.

The spacecraft contains attributes such as mining power, combat power, defense power, durability, and storage space. The attributes of the spacecraft directly determine its mining efficiency and the outcome of each battle.

Each time you perform a mission, the spacecraft will consume durability. When the durability is lower than 20%, the spacecraft will be forced to return to the base and enter the repair state. You can choose to repair automatically or use spar to accelerate repair. Different spaceships have different weapon spaces and armors. In space, you can buy weapons to increase the combat effectiveness of your spacecraft or purchase armor to increase the defense power of your spacecraft.

### Mecha

The mech is a mimic combat aircraft. It also has attributes such as mining power, combat power, defense power, durability, and storage space. Compared with the spacecraft, it has higher combat power and defense power, but due to its smaller size, it has durability, Storage space and mining power will be lower, and his attributes directly determine its mining efficiency and the outcome of each battle.

Each time you perform a task, the mecha will consume durability. When the durability is lower than 20%, the mecha will be forced to return to the base and enter the repair state. You can choose to repair automatically or use spar to accelerate the repair. Different mechas have different weapons. Space and armored space, you can buy weapons to increase the combat effectiveness of your mecha or purchase armor to increase the defense of your spaceship.

### Mining machinery

Mining machinery is a separate equipment for collecting spar.

You first need to own a spaceship and then buy it to purchase it. Its mining efficiency has nothing to do with the spacecraft’s mining power, and it will not occupy your spacecraft’s storage space. Each spacecraft can only carry a certain amount of mining machinery, the spacecraft’s The higher the mining power, the more machinery that can be carried, and the higher the level of machinery that can be carried, the smaller the number of machinery that can be carried.

There are five levels of mining machinery. The higher the level, the higher the efficiency of collecting spar.

### Armor

Each spaceship has its own armor value. It allows you to reduce damage during the battle. Purchasing armor will increase your armor value. The armor is divided into five levels. The effects of different levels of armor are as follows: The space occupied will also be different.

Armor includes two attributes: defense value and energy value. Each battle will damage the armor energy value to different degrees according to the attack power of the opponent's spacecraft, but it will not weaken its protection value. When the armor energy value returns to zero, the armor The space is automatically emptied, and you need to re-purchase armor to increase your defense value.

### Arms

Purchasing weapons can increase the attack value of the spacecraft. Weapons are divided into five levels. The higher the level, the higher the attack value and the larger the space occupied. The attack value of multiple weapons can be superimposed.

Each battle will consume the number of weapons according to the defense value of the enemy's spacecraft. The higher the enemy's defense value, the more weapons will be consumed. The minimum number of weapons consumed in each battle is 1. If the spaceship is equipped with weapons of different levels, the lowest The level of weapons starts to be consumed.

## Collect resources

With your own spaceship, you can perform basic mining tasks.

The mining power of the spacecraft determines the mining efficiency of the spacecraft. You can install mining machinery for it to increase its mining efficiency. It is worth noting that every time the spacecraft performs the task of collecting spar, it will damage the durability of the spacecraft.

If you want to get higher mining efficiency, go to a bigger planet, but this often means that you may be attacked by other players or interstellar pirates, fill your armor space and weapon space, he will not Increase your mining efficiency, but will make you safer when collecting spar.

When the spacecraft's storage space is full, the spacecraft will automatically return to the base. You can choose to re-execute the task of collecting spar, but the spacecraft cannot automatically perform the task. When the spacecraft is attacked during the process of collecting spar, it will automatically stop collecting spar , Once the battle fails, you will lose 50% of the spar in the storage space and return to the base.

## Fight

### Team

You can form a team with other players to complete the missions of collecting spar, attacking other players to plunder spar, or attacking other planets.

Form a team to fight, the spacecraft will have additional attack power and defense power bonuses. For each additional spacecraft, the attack power and defense power will be increased by 2%, and the maximum bonus rate is 10%.

Form a team to collect spar, and the rewards will be settled separately. The rewards for attacking the enemy spaceship or the team will be distributed proportionally according to the attack value of each spaceship in the team.

### Battle

When you are not within the sphere of influence of the galaxy, you may be attacked by other players.

If the battle fails, you will lose 50% of the spar in the space of your spacecraft. If you win the battle, you will get 30% of the spar in the space of the opponent's spacecraft, but not higher than the remaining space in your own internal space. If there is no spar in the internal space, the winner has no reward.

If the battle fails, the durability of the spacecraft will return to zero, and the spacecraft will be forced to return to the base to enter the repair process.

## Territory and construction

The Eternal War is divided into galaxies, stars, and land. The stars and land are virtual tokens supported by the blockchain (ERC-1155 and ERC-721 of NFTs), which are expressed as physical packages of The Eternal War meta-universe. The stars and land allow players to own a part of the meta-universe, so that they can host content assets. When the user trusts them to the central smart contract, the stars and land will be able to be constructed.

In addition to collecting the NFTs, the players occupying the NFTs can pledge them to the central contract of the platform, and build factories, commerce, properties, etc. to obtain more substantial benefits.

At the same time, the persistent map determines the player's specific land coordinates. In most blockchain games, the player's NFT is sold like real estate. The specific location of the NFT is crucial because it will determine who and what is next to you. Similarly, in The Eternal War, planets and lands need to be continuously explored, occupied, and obtained by battle. Their positions are initially determined on the map and cannot be moved from one coordinate on the universe map to another. This structure has several advantages:

A.  Players can unite the land through agents and create a larger game space with or near friends;

B.  Friends can cooperate to create these larger experiences, and share the rewards (whether economically, purely socially or artistically) by creating experiences together on the joint land.

Through a joint land, players can also get financial incentives. For example, if several players unite together, they can create a "business center" experience. Each member focuses on a key attraction, or members can focus on different communities to create a "city" experience together. In each case, the team’s efforts can allow players to cooperate to create a stronger motivation to visit and enjoy their creation-and more visits or generation will bring more benefits.

Yes, a player can maintain the income of all stars or land with one star or land. But the combination of larger and more diverse lands can increase financial incentive sharing fees. However, there are restrictions on connecting stars or lands together to prevent certain groups from having too much control and power against solo players.

### Planet

Divided into asteroids, large planets, super planets and S planets, planets within the sphere of influence of the galaxy and planets outside the sphere of influence of the galaxy. Collect Barite spars on the planets within the scope of the galaxy and will not be attacked by other players. Planets of different levels, The number of spacecraft that can accommodate mining is also different. The user can obtain a suitable planet ecology by transforming the planet for construction.

Different planets have different Barite spar content and difficulty in collecting. The larger the planet, the higher the Barite spar content, and the higher the efficiency of collection. However, other players may attack during the collection process. Players can use their own spacecraft. And equipment, go to the planet that suits you to mine Barite spar. If your spacecraft has relatively low attributes and you want to go to the big planet to collect Barite spar, it is a good choice to form a team with other players.

At present, there are 1,200 asteroids that have been proven, which are widely distributed in the entire space system. There are 500 large planets, 240 super large planets, and 80 S planets. The number of spacecraft that can accommodate mining on different planets is also different. Future players will continue to Exploration will allow more galaxies to be explored.

When the planet's spar is mined, the spacecraft for mining on the planet will return automatically, but the planet you occupy can still be built.

### Territory

If you capture a planet, then this planet will become your territory. On the planet, you can build fortifications to increase its attack and defense power and protect your planet. On it, you can replenish your own. Spaceships, or collection of resources, can charge other players who come, or refuse other players to come. You can even allow only designated players to come.

### Plot construction

At the same time, the occupied planets can be transformed and developed. Different planets will have different plots. You need to consume ETR to transform the ecology to activate the plots on the planet for the construction of different buildings. After construction, the plots will generate one NFT belongs to the builder. Both the territory and the stars can be traded freely.

You can also charge other players for coming, or you can refuse other players to come, or even you can only allow designated players to come.

## Spaceship upgrade

The system will set aside 40% of the deposit every day for repurchase purposes, and conduct a power settlement every 5-7 days. The spacecraft’s selling price and spacecraft’s mining power will increase by a certain extent based on the market’s previous cycle growth rate until the market no longer increases. , Every time a spacecraft is upgraded, players need to pay 10% of the spacecraft’s selling price as a development fund.

## Market

There will be an internal NFT market where players will be able to improve their economy by allowing them to trade, sell or acquire NFTs. These transactions will incur a tax cost of 15% in any form of use of the market, which will be refunded to the reward pool.

The market will use Etr as the default token, and users themselves specify the NFT price they deem appropriate to sell/purchase, so please pay attention to the price of each NFT in the market as much as possible! The spacecraft in the mission cannot be sold on the market.

## Token Economics

Serve as the universal currency of The Eternal War. Players use ETR to create characters and purchase spaceships and various equipment on The Eternal War market. The maximum supply is 15,800,000 pieces. Liquidity will be locked.

## ETR source

ETR is an important part of The Eternal War platform. The Eternal War is working to establish key mechanisms to make it closely connected with The Eternal War platform and its value. ETR is an ERC-20 utility token built on the Binance Smart Chain. It serves as the basis for transactions in the sandbox The Eternal War and has the following uses:

● Access to The Eternal War platform: Players spend ETR to play games, purchase equipment, or customize, and they can be collected through the game. Creators spend ETR to obtain assets, territories, equipment, and through the flow of methods. Territory, construction, and war drove the demand for ETR.

● Governance: ETR is a governance token, which enables holders to use a distributed autonomous organization structure to participate in the governance decision-making of the platform. They can exercise voting rights on key elements, such as attributes granted to content and creators, and feature priority on the platform's roadmap. ETR owners can vote by themselves or delegate the voting rights to other players of their choice.

● Construction: ETR construction, which enables more passive gains on the territory: You can obtain more ETR or resources by constructing buildings.

● Charging model: 5% (transaction fees) of all transactions conducted in ETR tokens will be allocated 50% to the liquidity pool as a reward for token holders who pledge ETR tokens for liquidity, and 50% will be given to the "Foundation" ".

● Foundation: The role of the foundation is to support The Eternal War ecosystem and provide funding to encourage high-quality content and game production on the platform. So far, the foundation has funded more than 15 game projects and formed a virtuous circle, which can provide funding for larger games.
