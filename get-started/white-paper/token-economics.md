### What will we do?

We have a strong product roadmap and a top team to execute a strong vision of building a unique virtual world gaming platform. On this platform, players can build, own and monetize their own gaming experience, and spread the power of blockchain as a leading technology in the gaming industry. All of these, combined with our current achievements, have made The Eternal War recognized as the most anticipated blockchain event.

We want to be available to individuals and businesses to increase liquidity and usability. The main purpose is to cooperate with community growth and ecosystem mobility. Regarding the proposed ETR supply, the community of creators and players will need to obtain ETR. We plan to enable the community to use ETR through a controllable supply mechanism, such as purchasing ETR from multiple exchanges. As the number of creators, players, and the number of assets exchanged in the community increase, the demand for ETR in the ecosystem may increase. Therefore, when the total supply of ETR is fixed, the amount of ETR initially provided will have a scarcity effect, reducing the per capita available ETR, thereby promoting demand.
