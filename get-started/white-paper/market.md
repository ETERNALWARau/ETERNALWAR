# Market

There will be an internal NFT market where players will be able to improve their economy by allowing them to trade, sell or acquire NFTs. These transactions will incur a tax cost of 15% in any form of use of the market, which will be refunded to the reward pool.

The market will use Etr as the default token, and users themselves specify the NFT price they deem appropriate to sell/purchase, so please pay attention to the price of each NFT in the market as much as possible! The spacecraft in the mission cannot be sold on the market.
