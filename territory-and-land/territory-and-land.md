# üåè Territory and land

The Eternal War is divided into galaxies, stars, and land. The stars and land are virtual tokens supported by the blockchain (ERC-1155 and ERC-721 of NFTs), which are expressed as physical packages of The Eternal War meta-universe. The stars and land allow players to own a part of the meta-universe, so that they can host content assets. When the user trusts them to the central smart contract, the stars and land will be able to be constructed.

In addition to collecting stars and land players, players occupying the NFTs can pledge them to the platform's central contract to build factories, commerce, and properties on them to obtain more substantial benefits.

At the same time, the persistent map determines the player's specific land coordinates. In most blockchain games, the player's NFT is sold like real estate. The specific location of the NFT is crucial because it will determine who and what is next to you. Similarly, in The Eternal War, planets and lands need to be continuously explored, occupied, and obtained by battle. Their positions are initially determined on the map and cannot be moved from one coordinate on the universe map to another. This structure has several advantages:

A. Players can unite the land through agents and create a larger game space with or near friends;

B. Friends can cooperate to create these larger experiences, and share the rewards (whether economically, purely socially or artistically) by creating experiences together on the joint land.

Through a joint land, players can also get financial incentives. For example, if several players unite together, they can create a "business center" experience. Each member focuses on a key attraction, or members can focus on different communities to create a "city" experience together. In each case, the team‚Äôs efforts can allow players to cooperate to create a stronger motivation to visit and enjoy their creation-and more visits or generation will bring more benefits.

Yes, a player can maintain the income of all stars or land with one star or land. But the combination of larger and more diverse lands can increase financial incentive sharing fees. However, there are restrictions on connecting stars or lands together to prevent certain groups from having too much control and power against solo players.
